# Smart-Home-Security-System
This project implements a simple Smart Home security system using an RFID sensor, gas sensor, and servo motor. The system is designed to open the door when a valid RFID tag is detected, while monitoring gas levels for safety purposes. The system also uses a buzzer and a lamp to alert the user if dangerous gas levels are detected.
